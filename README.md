# Screen_Dimmer

This application lets you adjust the brightness of up to 5 screens/monitors individually or at once. It is especially useful for controlling the brightness of external monitors for a desktop pc.

# How to use it
Go to ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85963782/149645904-cb455e0f-198f-4b4c-a82d-4f51f33781ce.png) and download the latest release. Extract the folder in the zip to somewhere you will remember, then open the folder, and run (double-click) ```Screen_Dimmer.exe```. A popup might come up saying "Windows protected your PC", if this happens click more info and run anyways. Now, go to your system tray (default is at the bottom of your screen) and click the show hidden icons button.
